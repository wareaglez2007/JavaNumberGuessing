Notes for TODO:

Java Coding Assignment 1:
        
 We are going to build a game in Java
 this game will NOT be run on the Mainframe
 
 Game Rules:
   the game will pick a random number between 1 and 1000
   
   the player gets 10 tries to guess the number
   
   the game will respond to each guess with:
      Too High or
      Too Low  or
      You Win
      
   if the player does not guess the number in 10 tries
   the game is over, and the game should display the 
   answer
  
   
   The following is a starting Java class,
     you will need to add the loop for 10 tries,
     along with the other logic required
     to play the game.
  
   Please build a new Java Project for this 
   assignment

		// generate a random number between 1 and 1000
		// the nextInt(1000) will give me a number 0-999
		// so I add 1
		int answer = rand.nextInt(1000) + 1;

		// TODO Output a welcome message

		// the game loop
		// TODO write a while loop to play the game
		{
			// TODO output a prompt asking the user to enter a guess

			// get a integer from the Console
			int guess = in.nextInt();

			// TODO check if the user's guess is
			// too low, too high or correct
			// if correct, break out of the loop

			// TODO increment the attempts counter

		} // end of loop

		// TODO if the user DID NOT win the game
		// output the answer

		in.close();
	} // end of main()
} // end of class
